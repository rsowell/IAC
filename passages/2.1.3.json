"title":"The Road to Corinth continued: Memories of Theseus and Melicertes",
"preReading":"The liminal territory between poleis can be a treacherous no-man’s land.  We have already met Theseus along the road from Attica to the isthmus where he tossed the robber Sciron into the sea.  Now we learn of two more of his famous deeds, the defeat of the wild boar Phaia and the brigand Sinis who stretches travelers between two pine trees.<br>In this section, Pausanias presents part two of Melicertes’ story: his tomb.  After his mother Ino throws herself and her son into the sea to escape the wrath of her husband Athamas, Melicertes is carried to dry land by a dolphin.  The hero Sisyphus discovers the body and buries the boy on the isthmus.",
