"title":"Two Famous Tombs near the gates of Crinth: Diogenes and Lais",
"preReading":"",
"postReading": "Most Greeks would consider the lives of Diogenes and Lais shameful and scandalous. Why would the Corinthians permit–indeed, show honor to–the tombs of Diogenes and Lais by siting them near the entrance to their city?  What about the lives of these two figures was appealing to the Corinthian ethos?",
"reading":"ἀνιοῦσι δὲ ἐς Κόρινθον καὶ ἄλλα ἐστὶ κατὰ τὴν ὁδὸν μνήματα καὶ πρὸς τῇ πύλῃ Διογένης τέθαπται ὁ Σινωπεύς, ὃν κύνα ἐπίκλησιν ἐστὶν ἄλσος ὀνομαζόμενον Κράνειον. ἐνταῦθα Βελλεροφόντου τέ ἐστι τέμενος καὶ Ἀφροδίτης ναὸς Μελαινίδος καὶ τάφος Λαΐδος, , δὴ λέαινα ἐπίθημά ἐστι κριὸν ἔχουσα ἐν τοῖς προτέροις ποσίν.",
